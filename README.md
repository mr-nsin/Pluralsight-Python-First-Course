"Rarely will you find a language as powerful and as versatile as Python. You can choose this language to write web apps, cross-platform desktop apps, Artificial Intelligence software, scripts, do scientific computation, and even create home automation software! For all that you need a good knowledge of Python. In this course, Python: Getting Started, you'll learn the basics of Python. First, you'll discover syntax, functions, and classes. Next, you'll explore how to create a console application and how to convert that same app into a web app. Finally, you'll learn how to create executable files and an installation wizard from your Python app. When you are finished with this course, you'll have a solid foundation to venture out and build your own apps using Python."
